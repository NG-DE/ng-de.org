## Call for Papers

**The CFP has been closed on Tuesday 18th at 23:59 CET.**

### The Selection Process

For the selection of talks we will follow the jsconf.eu process. That means:

- All submissions will be anonymized, so that there is no bias towards the submitter.
- All submissions will be reviewed and voted on by the jury.
- The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker details into account.

### The Jury
