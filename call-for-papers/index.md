### The Selection Process

For the selection of talks we will follow the jsconf.eu process. That means:

- All submissions will be anonymized, so that there is no bias towards the submitter.
- All submissions will be reviewed and voted on by the jury.
- The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker details into account.

### The Jury

The Jury of this year will be announced soon.

### If your talk gets selected

- We will cover your travel and accommodation (two nights) costs for the conference.
- The conference ticket is included for both days.
- We will add your talk, bio and Twitter handle on the website and promote you via our social media accounts before, during and after the conference.
- Your talk will be recorded and published on our YouTube channel after the conference.

We're looking forward to your submissions!
