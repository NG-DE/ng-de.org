  description: >
    This training will bring you basic RxJS skills!  
      
    RxJs is more popular than ever. It is backed into the Angular core and also used in frameworks like React, Vue, and others!  
    This doesn't surprise as it leverages a powerful and elegant way to work with sync as well as async collections.
      
    In this workshop, you will get an overview of this library. We will learn about the concept, approach and implementation of RxJS!  

    After a practical and detailed tour through observables we will implement our first stream-based code.  
    Sounds interesting? Looking forward to meeting you at the workshop.

    The state layer is one of those building block that can make developing and maintaining your application sweet and simple or a living hell.
    Having multiple existing solutions to choose from doesn't make the task much easier.
    
    Or maybe you should roll our your own, specifically tailored for your case?
    
    During this workshop we will explore several approaches and see which one solves what problems best.

- title: Handling Angular Forms Without Losing Your Sanity
  description: >
    "Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?" - Avril Lavigne, implementing Angular forms in 2019  
      
    Forms are such a basic part of web applications; how did they get so complicated? This talk will walk through Angular template driven vs. reactive forms and use cases for their implementation, basic & more complex form-validation, custom component implementations like typeahead and date-pickers, and finally use of the little-known Control Value Accessor interface to solve almost any form problem. This talk will also include some useful workarounds for those more complex PITA requirements that always seem to pop up in projects.

  description: >
    Imagine an astronaut using your Angular application in space. Accessibility is about providing the best user experience that leads to software made with people in difficult situations in mind. Such difficulties might be temporal, permanent or caused by the environment... like Space.  
      
    I’ll prepare your app for use in the pitch black of space and brightest of sunlight. I’ll implement navigation with voice commands, use a keyboard and touch-screen with gloves. I will show you how to produce accessible software that is ready-to-use even on a spaceship.

- title: Subjecting State to Good Behavior
  description: >
    Apps of all sizes need to manage state, but not all apps need a state machine like NgRx. What if we can't afford the code cost and indirection? What if we don't want to decouple our business layer? There's more to Angular state management than just getters and setters or a global stream. Let's set up readable, uncomplicated state management using behavior subjects, observables, and immutability — all OnPush ready. In this talk, we'll explore scaling up state management in Angular from extremely simple to more robust, and come away with knowledge that will help us gain a better understanding of Angular, RxJS, and even third party state management libraries.

  description: >
    Angular Material AND Bootstrap for your next Angular application? It doesn't make sense, does it? The first time I talked to my colleagues about combining the two, they laughed at me. But now, they love the approach because it works like a charm.  
    In this session, we will see how we can leverage the best parts of both libraries to build beautiful, maintainable, and responsive Angular applications with very little CSS.

- title: "Watch out: observers are here to stay"
  description: >
    The web is evolving, we got it. One of the clear consequences is the complexity of our web apps (formerly known as ‘websites’). The conciseness of functional programming and its fundamentals got our attention, but we knew we could do better. And now we have the Reactive programming model, a functional and declarative way of dealing with big amounts of data.  
      
    In the center of it we have Observables: objects responsible to keep your application alive, reacting to any mutation your data may have, through any period of time. We'll take a look on the concepts and also on the lib that implements it in Angular's core: RxJS. Using the provided operators, we have great power on our hands, doing anything imaginable in a concise, declarative and easy-to-maintain way.  
      
    Watch out: observables are here to stay!

- title: Scaling apps in two weeks with Angular
  description: >
    Application scalability is a two sided coin: it has to scale with both your user-base and your team size. But when you need to start a project, you don't know how big will it become -- it could go from “small” all the way to “Google-sized”. With so many variables to consider, how do you evaluate if Angular is the right solution? What challenges will you face along the way as your team and project grow?  
      
    This is the tale of how we went from nothing to a worldwide distributed platform, to a team 10 times bigger, from low traffic to 2M visits per day, and all the challenges we faced. And most important of all: how we set the whole thing up in 14 days.

- title: "Add Native Mobile to Your Angular Projects: The Migration Story"
  description: >
    The Angular and NativeScript teams teamed up to create a new way to share your code between web and mobile apps with Angular and NativeScript. It allows you to easily share the business logic of your app, while providing you an intuitive way to separate the code that is different between the platforms.  
      
    The ability to share code between your Angular web app and Native mobile apps has never been easier (or more important). Who has the time to invest resources into separate apps for web, native iOS, and native Android?  
      
    In this talk you will learn how to take an existing Angular Web project and add NativeScript to it, by converting it to a code-sharing project. Then we will go through a few steps of converting individual components and modules into a code-sharing structure.

- title: Stress Driven Development, and How to Avoid It
  description: >
    When was the last time you took a day off? How many times this week have you worked overtime? These questions are related to one thing we all experience on a daily basis - stress.  Employees who are trapped by their routine to ""deliver business value at all cost"", often forget to take care of themselves. Unfortunately, this work-related stress affects our loved ones too, because work-life balance that we all hear about, usually means work-life stress.  
      
    What if I were to say that it does not have to be this way? In this talk, we discuss ways how to relax and avoid ""Stress Driven Development."" We deep dive into common stressors, and draft a comprehensive guide to removing stress at work and in our personal lives.

- title: Do you want to build a build tool?
  description: >
    Tooling for code generation, transformation and interrogation has improved in leaps and bounds over the last few years! We now have things like Angular Schematics, Prettier and TSLint, that can manipulate code in powerful ways, speed up development, and provide insight into how our applications work. But how exactly do they work? This talk will be Code Tooling 101, and act as an introduction to Abstract Syntax Trees, and all the weird and wonderful things you can do with them. By the end of the talk, attendants should have an idea of how ASTs work, how they are used in code tooling, and how they can be used to manipulate and interrogate code at a structural level!

  description: >
    Dependency Injection framework is a core and inherent feature of both Nest and Angular. DI simplifies creating scalable, testable, and maintainable applications by giving us flexible and efficient abstractions. However, did we ever think how this mechanism works underneath? In this talk, we’ll compare how Nest and Angular DI systems differ from each other as well as dive into the basics of the metadata reflection API in TypeScript.

- title: What is this? Angular in my React?
  description: >
    Reusable components are a great idea. That is, until you find yourself working in a React app and you’re unable to reuse the great Angular components you’ve already built. Thankfully, there’s a way around this. If you need to support multiple frontend frameworks, you can harness the power of Angular Elements to do just that and build reusable shared components that will drop right in your app. In this talk, we’ll show you how you can manage components across different frontend frameworks and keep everyone happy.
