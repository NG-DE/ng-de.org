    In this interactive seminar you will develop a critical understanding for planning and implementing large enterprise applications with Angular. You will explore and work with approaches to structure huge applications like npm packages, the Mono Repo Approach and Micro Apps.  
      
    After this, you will deal with component design and reusable Web Components. For this, you will use several proven concepts and Angular Elements.  
      
    In addition, this workshop will enable you to develop a well-articulated understanding for implementing I18N as well as advanced authentication and authorization solutions that allow for single sign on and can be used to integrate with existing Identity Providers like Active Directory.

  description: >
    This training will bring you basic RxJS skills!  
      
    RxJs is more popular than ever. It is backed into the Angular core and also used in frameworks like React, Vue, and others!  
    This doesn't surprise as it leverages a powerful and elegant way to work with sync as well as async collections.
      
    In this workshop, you will get an overview of this library. We will learn about the concept, approach and implementation of RxJS!  

    After a practical and detailed tour through observables we will implement our first stream-based code.  
    Sounds interesting? Looking forward to meeting you at the workshop.

  description: >
    The state layer is one of those building block that can make developing and maintaining your application sweet and simple or a living hell.
    Having multiple existing solutions to choose from doesn't make the task much easier.
    
    Or maybe you should roll our your own, specifically tailored for your case?
    
    During this workshop we will explore several approaches and see which one solves what problems best.

    ngGirls aims to introduce women to the world of technology and increase diversity.
    Angular is a great technology to start with.
    We believe this is a win-win situation!
    We plan various events and activities in which the participants build and deploy a web application with Angular.
    We offer guidance to help finding a job in front end development.
    If you're a committed, motivated woman who wants to step into the Web Development world - your place is with us!  
      
    **Please note:** ngGirls is a free side event and not hosted by NG-DE itself. Please refer to [http://ng-girls.org/ng-de-2019/](http://ng-girls.org/ng-de-2019/){:target="_blank"} to register for the workshop.

- title: Handling Angular Forms Without Losing Your Sanity
  description: >
    "Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?" - Avril Lavigne, implementing Angular forms in 2019  
      
    Forms are such a basic part of web applications; how did they get so complicated? This talk will walk through Angular template driven vs. reactive forms and use cases for their implementation, basic & more complex form-validation, custom component implementations like typeahead and date-pickers, and finally use of the little-known Control Value Accessor interface to solve almost any form problem. This talk will also include some useful workarounds for those more complex PITA requirements that always seem to pop up in projects.

- title: "No Apollo-gies: Making Apps Accessible"
  description: >
    Imagine an astronaut using your Angular application in space. Accessibility is about providing the best user experience that leads to software made with people in difficult situations in mind. Such difficulties might be temporal, permanent or caused by the environment... like Space.  
      
    I’ll prepare your app for use in the pitch black of space and brightest of sunlight. I’ll implement navigation with voice commands, use a keyboard and touch-screen with gloves. I will show you how to produce accessible software that is ready-to-use even on a spaceship.

- title: Subjecting State to Good Behavior
  description: >
    Apps of all sizes need to manage state, but not all apps need a state machine like NgRx. What if we can't afford the code cost and indirection? What if we don't want to decouple our business layer? There's more to Angular state management than just getters and setters or a global stream. Let's set up readable, uncomplicated state management using behavior subjects, observables, and immutability — all OnPush ready. In this talk, we'll explore scaling up state management in Angular from extremely simple to more robust, and come away with knowledge that will help us gain a better understanding of Angular, RxJS, and even third party state management libraries.

- title: Angular Material or Bootstrap? Stop asking the question!
  description: >
    Angular Material AND Bootstrap for your next Angular application? It doesn't make sense, does it? The first time I talked to my colleagues about combining the two, they laughed at me. But now, they love the approach because it works like a charm.  
    In this session, we will see how we can leverage the best parts of both libraries to build beautiful, maintainable, and responsive Angular applications with very little CSS.
